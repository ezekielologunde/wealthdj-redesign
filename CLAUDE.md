## Obsidian Project Documentation

This project maintains a structured Obsidian-compatible documentation system under `docs/obsidian/`. It is the project's human-readable knowledge layer.

Whenever significant architecture, database, security, payment, feature, infrastructure, or product changes are made:

1. Determine which documentation files are affected.
2. Update the relevant documentation.
3. Preserve existing information unless it is demonstrably obsolete.
4. Never fabricate implementation details.
5. Use Obsidian-compatible Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`project`, `type`, `status`, `last_updated`).
6. Use [[Internal Links]] between related project notes.
7. Record important architectural decisions in Decisions.md.
8. Record significant changes in Changelog.md.
9. Keep documentation synchronized with the actual codebase.
10. Do not create duplicate documentation files unless explicitly instructed.

Documentation files:
- Project.md — project overview
- Architecture.md — system architecture and data flow
- Database.md — schema, relationships, RPCs, triggers, RLS policies, migrations
- Backend.md — backend services, APIs, RPCs, Edge Functions
- Frontend.md — UI and frontend architecture
- Security.md — auth, authorization, RLS, threat considerations, known risks
- Payments.md — payment lifecycle (mark placeholders clearly)
- Features.md — product capabilities (implemented / partial / planned / deprecated)
- Decisions.md — architecture and product decisions with rationale
- Bugs.md — known bugs and technical problems
- Tasks.md — outstanding implementation work
- Changelog.md — significant project changes
